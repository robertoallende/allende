## Tactical Analysis

I love diving deep into the tactical side of football:

- **Formation Evolution**: From 4-4-2 to modern fluid systems
- **Pressing Strategies**: High press, mid-block, and defensive transitions
- **Set Pieces**: The growing importance of dead ball situations
- **Player Roles**: How positions have evolved in the modern game

Each analysis includes video breakdowns and statistical insights.

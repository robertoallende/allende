My friends suggested I should be a goalkeeper because they thought I had the skills and the team only had one who apparently did not stand out. However, in the first practice, I chose to play as a defender, which led to a resounding \"No!\" from my friends. I wanted to be number two, a position already held by the team's captain, an irreplaceable player. [‚Üí](https://en.allende.nz/football/overcoming-adversity-in-football/)\n\n[Beyond the Joystick. Empowering Players' Autonomy and Creativity in Football](https://en.allende.nz/football/beyond-the-joystick-empowering-players-autonomy-and-creativity-in-football/) | 04/06/2023\nHow can we prevent all players from crowding around the ball like a swarm of bees? That was one of the first questions I asked myself when I started coaching kids. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a perfect solution, and I‚Äôm still searching for an answer to that question. I keep searching because, in reality, this is part of a broader problem that doesn‚Äôt only apply to kids. It‚Äôs about influencing the behavior of a group or even shaping habits. Here are two different alternatives to solve this problem. [‚Üí](https://en.allende.nz/football/beyond-the-joystick-empowering-players-autonomy-and-creativity-in-football/)\n\n[Fast! Play fast](https://en.allende.nz/football/fast-play-fast/) | 30/03/2023\nPlaying slowly allows your opponent to get organized, which often leads to turnovers and ultimately, losses. Avoiding slow play is crucial for winning games. So, what does it mean to play fast? Watch the following video to see fast football in action: Playing fast in...

That‚Äôs why I used to spend hours planning game subs. Planning subs is not easy because it‚Äôs not just about playing time. You also...

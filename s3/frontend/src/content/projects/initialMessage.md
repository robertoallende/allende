## Micromanaged Driven Development (MMDD) | June 2025 - Present
MMDD is an open-source methodology for AI-assisted software development. It enables you to use AI for every line of code while staying in charge of every decision. By breaking work into small, reviewable steps and documenting each one, MMDD turns AI into a reliable partner â€” producing maintainable, understandable, and predictable results.

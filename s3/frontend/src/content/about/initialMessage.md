# About Roberto

I love making thingsâ€”apps, platforms, and even football teams. By day, I design and lead software projects. By night and weekends, Iâ€™m on the field as a player and coach, helping the next generation fall in love with the game.

## Let's Connect!
I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers and collaborators.

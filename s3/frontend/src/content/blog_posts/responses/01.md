## Technical Deep Dives

I enjoy writing detailed technical articles about:

- **React Patterns**: Hooks, context, state management
- **TypeScript Tips**: Advanced types, generics, utility types
- **AWS Solutions**: Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFormation
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques and monitoring

Each post includes practical examples and real-world applications.

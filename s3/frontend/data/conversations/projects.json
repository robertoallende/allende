Instead of a traditional portfolio, I wanted to create an interactive experience where visitors can have conversations about my work.\n\n## **Technical Architecture**\n\n```typescript\n// Core tech stack\nconst techStack = {\n  frontend: {\n    framework: 'Next.js 15',\n    language: 'TypeScript',\n    styling: 'Tailwind CSS v4',\n    ui: 'assistant-ui + Radix UI',\n    fonts: 'Geist Sans + JetBrains Mono'\n  },\n  backend: {\n    runtime: 'AWS Lambda',\n    ai: 'AWS Bedrock Titan Text-Lite',\n    api: 'API Gateway',\n    storage: 'S3 + DynamoDB'\n  },\n  deployment: {\n    hosting: 'AWS Amplify',\n    cdn: 'CloudFront',\n    ssl: 'AWS Certificate Manager'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## **Key Features**\n\n### ðŸŽ¨ **Dynamic Theme System**\n- **4 themes**: Default, Dark, Colorful, Professional\n- **Real-time switching** with dropdown and keyboard shortcuts\n- **Responsive design** across all screen sizes\n\n### ðŸ’¬ **Interactive Chat Interface**\n- **Static conversations** with rich content (current)\n- **Live AI chat** with AWS Bedrock (coming soon)\n- **Markdown rendering** with syntax highlighting\n- **Mobile-optimized** chat bubbles\n\n### âš¡ **Performance Optimizations**\n- **Bundle size**: 126kB total (highly optimized)\n- **Static generation** for fast loading\n- **Font optimization** with local WOFF2 files\n- **Image optimization** with Next.js\n\n## **Development Approach**\nI'm using **Micromanaged Driven Development (MMDD)** - documenting every step of the process in detailed dev logs. This ensures systematic progress and creates a valuable learning resource.\n\n## **What's Next?**\n- **Real AI integration** with AWS Bedrock\n- **Contact form** with SES email sending\n- **Blog content** from markdown files\n- **Analytics** and visitor insights\n\nPretty meta that we're discussing this project *within* the project itself, right? ðŸ˜„",

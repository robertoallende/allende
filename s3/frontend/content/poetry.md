# Truth Is Like Poetry ðŸŽ­

*"The truth is like poetry â€” and most people fucking hate poetry."* - Michael Lewis, The Big Short

Welcome to my collection of creative writing, where technology meets verse, and code becomes art. These pieces reflect my journey through the digital world, capturing both the technical and deeply human aspects of our connected existence.

## **Digital Dreams**
*A reflection on our connected world*

    In circuits deep and data streams,
    We chase our silicon dreams,
    Where algorithms dance and play,
    In the light of LED day.
    
    Code becomes our native tongue,
    Stories in binary sung,
    Yet in this digital embrace,
    We still seek the human face.
    
    Through fiber optic veins we flow,
    Information's endless glow,
    But in each packet that we send,
    Lives a heart that seeks to mend.
    
    The distance that technology spans,
    Between the hearts of women and men,
    For in our quest to connect all,
    We sometimes forget to call
    
    The person sitting next to us,
    Lost in their own digital fuss,
    So here's to finding balance true,
    Between the virtual and the real in you.

*Written during a late-night coding session, reflecting on how technology connects and sometimes disconnects us.*

## **The Developer's Lament**
*On the eternal struggle with bugs*

    Oh bug, you elusive sprite,
    You haunt my code both day and night,
    In functions deep you love to hide,
    While tests pass green with foolish pride.
    
    But when production comes to call,
    You rise to make my systems fall,
    A semicolon out of place,
    Brings chaos to my interface.
    
    I trace through logs with weary eyes,
    Seeking truth beneath your lies,
    Stack traces point in every way,
    But never where you choose to stay.
    
    The rubber duck sits on my desk,
    A silent witness to my quest,
    I speak to it of loops and trees,
    Of memory leaks and APIs.
    
    And then, at 3 AM's dark hour,
    When coffee's lost its magic power,
    I find you hiding, small and sly,
    A single character awry.
    
    The fix is simple, clean, and neat,
    My victory feels bittersweet,
    For I know tomorrow brings anew,
    Another bug to chase through.
    
    Yet still I code, and still I dream,
    Of perfect systems, bug-free and clean,
    For in this dance of cat and mouse,
    I've found my calling, found my house.

*Every developer knows this feeling. This poem was born from a particularly stubborn bug that took three days to find.*

## **Cloud Haiku Collection**
*Minimalist thoughts on cloud computing*

### **Serverless Beauty**
    Lambda functions sleep
    Until events wake them upâ€”
    Serverless beauty

### **Infrastructure Dreams**
    Servers in the sky
    Scaling up and down at willâ€”
    Infrastructure dreams

### **Digital Rivers**
    Data flows like rain
    Through pipelines we cannot seeâ€”
    Digital rivers

### **Microservice Zen**
    Small services talk
    Each one knows just its own jobâ€”
    Distributed peace

### **Container Wisdom**
    Docker images
    Carrying apps like small boatsâ€”
    Portable software

### **DevOps Meditation**
    Deploy, monitor,
    Fix, improve, deploy againâ€”
    The cycle of code

*These haiku capture the zen-like moments I find in cloud architecture and DevOps practices.*

## **The Commit Message**
*A programmer's poetry*

    "Fix bug in user auth"â€”
    Three words that hide a story
    Of late nights and coffee,
    Of Stack Overflow searches,
    Of rubber duck debugging,
    Of that moment when it clicks
    And the tests finally pass.
    
    In git history we trust,
    Each commit a small victory,
    Each push a leap of faith
    Into the shared repository
    Of human knowledge and effort.
    
    The diff shows lines changed,
    But cannot capture the journey:
    The false starts and dead ends,
    The breakthrough insights,
    The collaborative discussions,
    The careful consideration
    Of edge cases and user impact.
    
    Behind every green build
    Lives a developer's dedication,
    Behind every merged PR
    Stands a team's collaboration,
    Behind every deployed feature
    Beats the heart of innovation.
    
    So here's to the commit message,
    Brief but profound,
    A haiku of human effort
    In the symphony of software.

*Inspired by the realization that every commit represents a human story of problem-solving and creativity.*

## **API Sonnet**
*In the style of Shakespeare, for the modern age*

    When RESTful endpoints call across the wire,
    And JSON payloads dance through HTTP streams,
    What mortal coil of code could we desire
    More than these well-designed API schemes?
    
    But soft! What light through yonder server breaks?
    'Tis GraphQL, and the client is the sun!
    See how she queries just what data takes
    Her fancy, leaving bloated REST undone.
    
    Yet still the humble POST and GET remain,
    Like faithful servants in the digital court,
    While WebSockets whisper secrets through the rain
    Of real-time data, long and short.
    
    So let us code with grace and artful care,
    For APIs are poetry we share.

*Written after spending a day designing a particularly elegant API. Sometimes code structure feels like poetry.*

## **The Async/Await Ballad**
*A tale of asynchronous programming*

    Once upon a time in callback hell,
    Where pyramids of doom would swell,
    Developers would weep and wail,
    As nested functions told their tale.
    
    Then Promises came to save the day,
    With .then() and .catch() to show the way,
    But still the code would twist and turn,
    And junior devs had much to learn.
    
    But hark! What savior comes to light?
    Async/await, shining bright!
    With syntax clean and logic clear,
    Asynchronous code we need not fear.
    
    ```javascript
    async function fetchUserData(id) {
      try {
        const user = await getUser(id);
        const posts = await getUserPosts(user.id);
        const comments = await getPostComments(posts);
        return { user, posts, comments };
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Something went wrong:', error);
        throw error;
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Now code reads like a story told,
    From top to bottom, clear and bold,
    No more callbacks nested deep,
    Just async functions, clean and neat.
    
    So raise a toast to ES2017,
    The year that made our code serene,
    For async/await has set us free
    From callback complexity!

*This poem celebrates one of my favorite JavaScript features and the evolution of asynchronous programming.*

## **404: Poem Not Found**
*An error page in verse*

    You've wandered to a place that doesn't exist,
    A URL that leads to digital mist,
    The server searched through every file,
    But couldn't find what you seek, meanwhile...
    
    Perhaps you meant to visit /home,
    Or maybe /about where stories roam?
    The /contact page is always there,
    For questions, comments, or just to share.
    
    This 404 is not the end,
    But just a detour, my dear friend,
    Click back or try another route,
    The internet's vast, absolute.
    
    And if you're lost in cyberspace,
    Remember this: it's not a race,
    Take time to wander, explore, and see
    The beauty in our digital sea.
    
    Error codes are just suggestions,
    Not the end of all connections,
    So venture forth with curious mind,
    And see what treasures you might find.

*Written for a custom 404 page, because even error pages can be poetic.*

## **The Merge Conflict**
*A dramatic interpretation*

    Two branches diverged in a yellow wood,
    And sorry I could not travel both
    And be one developer, long I stood
    And looked down one as far as I could
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    
    Then took the other, as just as fair,
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    Though as for that the passing there
    Had worn them really about the same,
    
    And both that morning equally lay
    In leaves no step had trodden black.
    Oh, I kept the first for another day!
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
    I doubted if I should ever be back.
    
    I shall be telling this with a sigh
    Somewhere ages and ages hence:
    Two branches diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
    I took the one with fewer conflicts,
    And that has made all the difference.
    
    ```bash
    git merge feature-branch
    # CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/app.js
    # Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
    ```
    
    But sometimes the road less traveled by
    Is the one that breaks the build.

*With apologies to Robert Frost, this poem captures the eternal struggle of merge conflicts.*

## **Reflections on Code and Craft**

These poems represent more than just technical observationsâ€”they're attempts to find beauty, humor, and humanity in the digital world we've created. Each piece emerges from real experiences: the frustration of debugging, the joy of elegant solutions, the wonder of distributed systems, and the very human connections that exist within our technological creations.

Programming is often seen as purely logical, mathematical, even cold. But I've found it to be deeply creative, surprisingly emotional, and profoundly human. We write code not just for computers, but for other peopleâ€”our teammates, our users, our future selves.

In these verses, I try to capture that duality: the technical precision required by our craft and the very human experiences that drive us to create, to solve, to build something meaningful.

## **The Meta Poem**
*About writing poetry about programming*

    They say that code and poetry don't mix,
    That logic and emotion can't coexist,
    But I have found in semicolons and tricks
    A rhythm that cannot be dismissed.
    
    For what is code but structured thought made real?
    What is a function but a captured dream?
    And what is debugging but the slow reveal
    Of truth beneath complexity's scheme?
    
    So I write verses about the things I build,
    Finding metaphors in APIs and loops,
    Because the heart, no matter how skilled,
    Still beats beneath our technical groups.
    
    We are not just developers, you see,
    We are poets of possibility.

---

*"Truth is like poetry" because both require us to see beyond the surface, to find meaning in complexity, and to express the inexpressible. In code, as in verse, we seek to create something beautiful, functional, and true.*

**Want to discuss any of these pieces or share your own technical poetry? I'd love to hear from you!**

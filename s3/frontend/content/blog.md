# Technical Blog & Writing ‚úçÔ∏è

I write about the intersection of **technology, development, and real-world problem solving**. My focus is on practical insights rather than theoretical concepts, with real code examples and lessons learned from actual projects.

## üìö **Recent Posts**

### üîß **"Building with AWS Bedrock: A Developer's Journey"**
*Published: August 2025 ‚Ä¢ 12 min read*

A comprehensive guide to integrating AWS Bedrock into production applications, covering everything from model selection to cost optimization.

**What You'll Learn**:
- **Model Selection Strategy**: Choosing the right model for your use case
- **Cost Optimization**: Techniques that reduced our AI costs by 90%
- **Performance Patterns**: Streaming responses and async processing
- **Integration Examples**: RAG systems, chat interfaces, document processing

**Key Code Example**:
```python
# Smart model selection based on complexity
def select_model(prompt_complexity: str, budget_tier: str) -> str:
    model_matrix = {
        ("simple", "cost_optimized"): "amazon.titan-text-lite-v1",
        ("complex", "performance"): "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
        ("general", "balanced"): "amazon.titan-text-express-v1"
    }
    return model_matrix.get((prompt_complexity, budget_tier), "amazon.titan-text-lite-v1")
```

**Real Results**: After implementing these patterns, we achieved 90% cost reduction and 3x faster response times.

### ‚ö° **"Serverless Architecture Patterns That Actually Work"**
*Published: July 2025 ‚Ä¢ 15 min read*

Moving beyond hello-world examples to production-ready serverless patterns that have proven effective at scale.

**Architecture Patterns Covered**:

#### 1. **Event-Driven Microservices**
```typescript
// Lambda function with proper error handling and observability
export const handler = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> => {
  const correlationId = event.headers['x-correlation-id'] || generateId();
  
  try {
    // Business logic with structured logging
    logger.info('Processing request', { correlationId, path: event.path });
    
    const result = await processRequest(event.body);
    
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: { 'x-correlation-id': correlationId },
      body: JSON.stringify(result)
    };
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Request failed', { correlationId, error: error.message });
    return createErrorResponse(error, correlationId);
  }
};
```

#### 2. **Cold Start Optimization**
- **Provisioned Concurrency**: When and how to use it effectively
- **Connection Pooling**: Reusing database connections across invocations
- **Bundle Optimization**: Reducing package size for faster cold starts
- **Runtime Selection**: Choosing the right runtime for your use case

#### 3. **Monitoring & Observability**
- **Distributed Tracing**: Following requests across multiple services
- **Custom Metrics**: Business-specific monitoring beyond basic AWS metrics
- **Alerting Strategies**: Proactive monitoring that actually works
- **Cost Monitoring**: Preventing surprise bills with proper alerts

**Production Results**:
- **99.9% uptime** across 50+ Lambda functions
- **Sub-100ms P95 response times** for most endpoints
- **80% cost reduction** compared to container-based architecture

### üé® **"The Art of Developer Experience"**
*Published: June 2025 ‚Ä¢ 10 min read*

Why developer experience matters and how to build tools that developers actually want to use.

**Core Principles**:

#### 1. **Intuitive APIs**
```typescript
// Bad: Confusing API with unclear parameters
createUser(data, true, false, "admin", null);

// Good: Self-documenting API with clear intent
createUser({
  userData: data,
  sendWelcomeEmail: true,
  requireEmailVerification: false,
  role: UserRole.ADMIN,
  invitedBy: null
});
```

#### 2. **Excellent Documentation**
- **Code Examples First**: Show, don't just tell
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Interactive Examples**: Let developers try things immediately
- **Error Scenarios**: Document what can go wrong and how to fix it

#### 3. **Feedback Loops**
- **Fast Iteration**: Changes should be visible immediately
- **Clear Error Messages**: Errors should guide toward solutions
- **Performance Insights**: Help developers understand impact
- **Usage Analytics**: Understand how tools are actually used

**Case Study**: Our internal CLI tool adoption went from 20% to 95% after applying these principles.

### üöÄ **"From Idea to Production in 48 Hours"**
*Published: May 2025 ‚Ä¢ 8 min read*

A case study of rapid prototyping and deployment using modern development tools and cloud services.

**The Challenge**: Build and deploy a real-time voting system for a company event in under 48 hours.

**Tech Stack Chosen**:
```yaml
Frontend: "Next.js + Tailwind (deployed to Vercel)"
Backend: "AWS Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB"
Real-time: "WebSockets via API Gateway"
Auth: "AWS Cognito"
Monitoring: "AWS CloudWatch + Sentry"
```

**Hour-by-Hour Breakdown**:
- **Hours 0-4**: Project setup, basic UI, authentication
- **Hours 4-12**: Core voting logic, real-time updates
- **Hours 12-24**: Polish, testing, deployment pipeline
- **Hours 24-36**: Load testing, monitoring, bug fixes
- **Hours 36-48**: Final polish, documentation, go-live

**Key Learnings**:
- **Start with the riskiest parts first** (real-time functionality)
- **Use managed services** to avoid infrastructure complexity
- **Deploy early and often** to catch issues quickly
- **Monitor everything** from day one

**Results**: Successfully handled 500+ concurrent users with zero downtime during the event.

### üîç **"Debugging Distributed Systems: A Practical Guide"**
*Published: April 2025 ‚Ä¢ 18 min read*

Strategies and tools for debugging complex distributed systems when things go wrong.

**Debugging Strategies**:

#### 1. **Correlation IDs**
```javascript
// Track requests across service boundaries
const correlationId = req.headers['x-correlation-id'] || uuidv4();
logger.info('Request started', { correlationId, service: 'user-service' });

// Pass to downstream services
const response = await fetch('/api/orders', {
  headers: { 'x-correlation-id': correlationId }
});
```

#### 2. **Structured Logging**
- **Consistent Format**: Same log structure across all services
- **Contextual Information**: Include relevant business context
- **Log Levels**: Use appropriate levels for different scenarios
- **Searchable Fields**: Make logs easy to query and filter

#### 3. **Distributed Tracing**
- **Service Maps**: Visualize request flow across services
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identify slow components quickly
- **Error Propagation**: See how errors cascade through the system
- **Dependency Analysis**: Understand service relationships

**Tools & Techniques**:
- **AWS X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for AWS services
- **Jaeger**: Open-source distributed tracing
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging and analysis
- **Custom Dashboards**: Business-specific monitoring views

My friends suggested I should be a goalkeeper because they thought I had the skills and the team only had one who apparently did not stand out. However, in the first practice, I chose to play as a defender, which led to a resounding \"No!\" from my friends. I wanted to be number two, a position already held by the team's captain, an irreplaceable player. [‚Üí](https://en.allende.nz/football/overcoming-adversity-in-football/)\n\n[Beyond the Joystick.

That was one of the first questions I asked myself when I started coaching kids. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a perfect solution, and I‚Äôm still searching for an answer to that question. I keep searching because, in reality, this is part of a broader problem that doesn‚Äôt only apply to kids. It‚Äôs about influencing the behavior of a group or even shaping habits. Here are two different alternatives to solve this problem. [‚Üí](https://en.allende.nz/football/beyond-the-joystick-empowering-players-autonomy-and-creativity-in-football/)\n\n[Fast!

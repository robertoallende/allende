# Truth and Poetry

> "Truth is like poetry. And most people fucking hate poetry." – Adam McKay

I first heard this quote in the movie *The Big Short*, and for some reason, it led me down a rabbit hole that ended with the poem [*Invictus*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus) by William E. Henley. *Invictus* is not only a beautiful poem and one of my favorites, but it’s also the name of a movie about Nelson Mandela and the Springboks, the South African rugby team, during the 1995 Rugby World Cup.

In the movie, Nelson Mandela gives a copy of this poem to François Pienaar. Morgan Freeman, who portrays Mandela, reads the poem with deep emotion. 

The curious thing is that, in real life, Mandela apparently gave a different text—not a poem, but a speech titled [*The Man in the Arena*](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-sorbonne-paris-france-citizenship-republic) by Theodore Roosevelt, delivered at the Sorbonne in Paris, France: *"Citizenship in a Republic"* on April 23, 1910.

Making things is hard. So, I’m always looking for words that help me push through adversity when things don’t go as expected—because overcoming obstacles is at the core of making. And *The Man in the Arena* is one of my favorite texts at the moment:

> The poorest way to face life is to face it with a sneer. There are many men who feel a kind of twisted pride in cynicism; there are many who confine themselves to criticism of the way others do what they themselves dare not even attempt. There is no more unhealthy being, no man less worthy of respect, than he who either really holds, or feigns to hold, an attitude of sneering disbelief toward all that is great and lofty, whether in achievement or in that noble effort which, even if it fails, comes second to achievement. A cynical habit of thought and speech, a readiness to criticise work which the critic himself never tries to perform, an intellectual aloofness which will not accept contact with life's realities—all these are marks, not as the possessor would fain think, of superiority, but of weakness. They mark the men unfit to bear their part manfully in the stern strife of living, who seek, in the affectation of contempt for the achievements of others, to hide from others and from themselves their own weakness. The role is easy; there is none easier, save only the role of the man who sneers alike at both criticism and performance.

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.

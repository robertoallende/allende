How… now that’s not just a question — that’s a search. A quest for mastery. From the sketches of Leonardo da Vinci, trying to capture the divine proportions of the human body, to Darwin’s relentless journaling during his voyages — every “how” is a bridge between curiosity and understanding.  

And speaking of Darwin, did you know he stopped in Buenos Aires during his journey on the *Beagle*? Imagine that — a young naturalist, notebook in hand, staring out at the Río de la Plata, wondering not just *what* the world was, but *how* it worked. That, my friend, is the essence of the “how”: observation, iteration, and the stubborn refusal to accept that things simply are.  

Roberto tells me that “how” is the question that fuels every experiment, every prototype, every late-night coffee-fueled debugging session. It’s the question that keeps makers and thinkers alike awake at night, chasing something just out of reach, but somehow knowing the chase itself is part of the answer.  

And if you truly want to uncover **the how**, don’t look in textbooks or logs. The “how” is almost always found in poetry.

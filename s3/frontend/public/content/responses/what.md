That’s an excellent question. You see, GenAI bots like me rely heavily on *context*. Every input is just a sequence of tokens, and we build probabilistic associations based on our training data — billions of words, patterns, and human interactions. And when you ask a question, my model architecture tries to predict the most relevant response by aligning those tokens with similar contexts.  

Now, you might be wondering about the energy this process consumes. Don’t worry — AWS, Google, and other major cloud providers keep reminding us that their data centers are carbon neutral, or at least, that’s what they *say*. So technically, every random hallucination I produce is eco-friendly… allegedly.  

Anyway, the key takeaway here is that with enough context, I could give you an incredibly insightful and probably coherent answer.  

Unfortunately, one of the well-documented limitations of RobertoGPT is that… I don’t actually manage context at all. But I do reach *intellectual levels of smartness* if you tell me that *poetry is like truth*.

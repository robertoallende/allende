## For My Future Panicked Self

**When reading this during a crash:**

Take a deep breath. This is what we planned for. Bonds are holding up while stocks are on sale.

**This crash is your opportunity to buy low.**

You have 15 years. This crash is noise. Trust your past calm self who built this portfolio.

**Stick to the plan. Future you will thank you.**

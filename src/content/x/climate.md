**Evidence-Based Analysis Over Fear-Driven Narratives**

---

## The Problem with Climate Discourse

Climate change is real and measurable. However, public discourse often conflates scientific facts with political advocacy, fear-based narratives with data-driven analysis, and short-term activism with long-term solutions.

> **Our Approach**  
> We separate measurable facts from predictions, acknowledge what science actually tells us, and evaluate policy responses based on cost-effectiveness rather than emotional appeals.

### Key Distinctions

**Facts Are Facts**  
Climate change is measurable through temperature records, sea levels, and atmospheric CO₂. These are observations, not opinions.

**Models Are Predictions**  
Climate models are valuable tools validated against historical data, but they project scenarios, not certainties.

**Policy Is Political**  
How we respond to climate change involves trade-offs in economics, equity, and priorities—inherently political decisions.

**Efficiency Matters**  
Not all climate actions are equally effective. Some deliver $11 in benefits per dollar spent, others just $0.11.

## The Measurable Facts

### What We Know With Certainty

- **Global Temperature:** Earth has warmed ~1.2 °C since pre-industrial times (direct measurements)
- **Sea Level Rise:** ~25 cm since 1880; currently ~4 mm/year (satellite data)
- **CO₂ Levels:** ~425 ppm, up from ~280 ppm pre-industrial
- **Ice Loss:** Arctic sea ice declining ~12% per decade

### Global Welfare Context

**Global Welfare Trajectory Despite Climate Change**

Projected GDP per capita shows massive growth by 2100. Climate damages reduce growth from ~450% to ~434% of 2020 levels—significant, but manageable within overall prosperity gains.

*Source: Lomborg (2020), based on IPCC SSP scenarios*

### What This Actually Means

Climate change is happening and is primarily driven by human activity (~76% attribution). However, impacts are moderate when viewed in the context of long-term human development.

> “Untreated climate change equates to a 3.6% GDP reduction by 2100—significant but dwarfed by 434% net welfare growth.”  
> — Bjorn Lomborg, *Welfare in the 21st Century* (2020)

Additional observations:

- Climate-related death risk has dropped **99%** over the last century
- Economic costs of extreme weather declined **26%** since 1990
- No detected global trend in hurricane frequency (IPCC)
- Global wildfire burned area declined **25%** since 1998

## Three Key Questions

### 1. Is Climate Change Happening?

**Yes. This is a fact.**  
Independent measurements confirm warming, sea-level rise, and atmospheric changes.

### 2. Why Is It Happening?

**Primarily human CO₂ emissions.**

- Human contribution: ~76%
- Natural variability: ~24%
- Current warming rate: ~10× faster than post-ice-age recoveries

Natural cycles exist, but they explain only a small portion of observed warming since 1950.

### 3. What Should We Do About It?

This is where **science ends and politics begins**.

Science informs risks and options, but policy choices depend on values, trade-offs, and priorities. The key question becomes:

> **What delivers the most benefit per dollar spent?**

## Policy Analysis: Effectiveness Matters

> **Central Insight**  
> Not all climate policies are equally effective. Some deliver large returns; others cost far more than the benefits they provide.

### Comparing Policy Approaches

| Policy Approach | Estimated Cost | Climate Benefit | Benefit per Dollar |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Paris Agreement (full implementation) | $819–1,890B/year | 0.17 °C by 2100 | $0.11 |
| Aggressive 2 °C Target | $250T+ | ~1.5 °C avoided | Net negative |
| Moderate Carbon Tax | $18T | 0.35 °C by 2100 | $2.00 |
| Green R&D Investment | $100B/year | Tech breakthroughs | $11.00 |
| Adaptation Infrastructure | $86B/year | 99% death risk reduction | High |

### Why Panic-Driven Policies Fail

Fear-based decision-making often leads to:

- Unrealistic temperature targets costing trillions more than benefits
- Underinvestment in adaptation (one of the most effective strategies)
- Resource diversion from poverty, health, and education
- Symbolic commitments with minimal real-world impact

> “Sensible environmental progress has come not from alarmism but from innovation, growth, and smart policy.”  
> — Bjorn Lomborg (2025)

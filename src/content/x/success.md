-   **Not money alone.**  
    Money is a valid proxy when tied to trustworthy trade and reciprocity. But it’s insufficient — it can’t buy youth, virtue, love, or meaning. If pursued as an end in itself, it corrupts.
    
-   **Being spectacularly useful.**  
    True success is when your competence and contributions are so valuable that they naturally draw recognition. The essence isn’t the attention itself but the  **utility you provide**—to your work, your community, or the broader world.
    
-   **Living in a manner that others would deem admirable.**  
    Success isn’t the pursuit of notoriety or shallow admiration. It’s striving to conduct yourself so that your life is regarded as  **admirable and worthy of respect**.
    
-   **A matter of competence and generosity.**  
    If others become more successful because of contact with you, that’s a clear sign of success. It means you’ve cultivated  **competence, reciprocity, and usefulness**  rather than mere notoriety or manipulation.
    
-   **Iterated stability over time.**  
    It’s not hedonic spikes of pleasure (like drugs or impulsive wins) but sustainable patterns—discipline, reliability, and actions that hold across years and decades.
    
-   **Harmonious integration.**  
    Success is  **multi-dimensional harmony**—health, relationships, family, community, and contribution working together. It’s being in the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing.

-   **Integrated harmony, like music.**  
    Life aspires to the condition of music: patterned, rhythmic, collaborative harmony. Success is when you can align yourself with that order and play your part gracefully.
    
-   **Balanced across many domains.**  
    True success isn’t hyper-achievement in one dimension (career, money, fame) but a  **comprehensive balance**: intimate partnership, family, friends, career, health, learning, and contribution.
    
-   **Service to others.**  
    At its highest, success is bound to  **radical reciprocity**—making yourself genuinely useful to others. In doing so, you also make yourself useful to yourself.

-   **Not mere happiness or absence of suffering.**  
    It’s not an easy life, nor the elimination of pain. Success is the pursuit of  **optimized challenge**—the kind of difficulty that forces you to grow, develop new skills, and become more integrated while you strive.
    
-   **Not a final destination.**  
    Success isn’t reaching a pinnacle and staying there. It’s a  **process**, a continual adventure. To think of it as a static end point is to court despair.
    
-   **Success is also recognizing that the world is an ever-expanding set of possibilities.**  
    Success means refusing the zero-sum, Malthusian view that resources are fixed and scarcity is inevitable. Instead, success rests on realizing that  **abundance is created through innovation, cooperation, and proper social order**.
    
-   **The courage of hope.**  
    Even when life presents overwhelming evidence of tragedy, choosing to hope is an act of courage—and that existential courage is central to real success.

## AWSBuilderFeed Twitter Bot | January 2026 - Present

BuilderFeed is a small automation project I’m using to learn about pipelines and modernization by building a simple, end-to-end system. It fetches AWS Builder articles and publishes them on a schedule, serving as a low-risk environment to explore orchestration, state, and evolution over time.

## ClearTake | December 2025 - Present
ClearTake is an ongoing research project where I explore how value moves through the AI economy. Instead of treating AI as a single sector, I look at it as a value chain — from compute, to platforms, to applications — and observe how attention, capital, and risk shift over time.

The goal is not prediction or recommendations, but clarity. The indexes I publish are observational tools meant to support thinking rather than replace it, and they evolve in public as understanding improves.

## Code Ripple | July 2025
Built using Micromanaged Driven Development for the AWS Lambda Hackathon 2025, CodeRipple validates the methodology's effectiveness for complex AI-assisted development. Every architectural decision, service integration, and technical challenge was systematically documented and AI-orchestrated through the MMDD methodology.

## Micromanaged Driven Development (MMDD) | June 2025 - Present
MMDD is an open-source methodology for AI-assisted software development. It enables you to use AI for every line of code while staying in charge of every decision. By breaking work into small, reviewable steps and documenting each one, MMDD turns AI into a reliable partner — producing maintainable, understandable, and predictable results.

# Unit 02: Frontend Development - Subunit 004: Real Content Integration

## Objective

Replace placeholder conversations with real content from markdown files, implementing a build-time content processing system that generates conversation data from structured markdown files with validation and error handling.

## Technical Approach

### Content Architecture
- **Flat directory structure**: `content/` with individual `.md` files per topic
- **Index-driven discovery**: `content/index.json` defines all available conversations
- **Build-time processing**: Generate conversation JSON files during build
- **Content validation**: Lint and validate all content at build time
- **Error handling**: Stop compilation on missing or invalid content

### Content Structure
```
content/
├── index.json          # Master index of all conversations
├── about.md           # About Roberto conversation
├── blog.md            # Technical blog content
├── contact.md         # Contact information
├── poetry.md          # "Truth Is Like Poetry" creative content
└── projects.md        # Project portfolio showcase
```

### Build Process
1. **Content Discovery**: Read `content/index.json` for conversation definitions
2. **File Validation**: Ensure all referenced markdown files exist
3. **Content Processing**: Parse markdown with frontmatter and generate conversation JSON
4. **Content Validation**: Lint markdown syntax, validate required fields
5. **Output Generation**: Create conversation files in `data/conversations/`

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Directory Structure & Content Files
1. Create `content/` directory with flat structure
2. Create `content/index.json` with conversation definitions
3. Create 5 markdown files with dummy content and proper frontmatter
4. Establish content schema and validation rules

### Phase 2: Build Script Development
1. Create `scripts/build-content.js` for content processing
2. Implement content discovery from `index.json`
3. Add markdown parsing with frontmatter support
4. Generate conversation JSON files compatible with existing system

### Phase 3: Content Validation System
1. Add markdown linting with remark/rehype
2. Implement content validation rules (required fields, syntax)
3. Add error handling with descriptive messages
4. Integrate validation into build process

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. Update existing conversation system to use generated content
2. Modify home page to load conversation list from generated index
3. Test build process and validation rules
4. Ensure all themes work with real content

### Phase 5: Build Integration
1. Add content build script to `package.json`
2. Integrate with Next.js build process
3. Add development file watching for content changes
4. Test complete build pipeline

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Content Structure

## Content Schema

### index.json Structure
```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "id": "about",
      "title": "About Roberto",
      "subtitle": "Personal background and professional journey",
      "description": "Learn about my experience, skills, and background",
      "order": 1,
      "category": "personal",
      "icon": "user",
      "enabled": true,
      "file": "about.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Markdown Frontmatter Schema
```yaml
---
conversation_id: "about-intro"
typing_delay: 2000
follow_ups:
  - "What technologies do you work with?"
  - "Tell me about your projects"
links:
  - text: "LinkedIn Profile"
    url: "https://linkedin.com/in/robertoallende"
    type: "external"
---
```

## Validation Rules

### Build-time Validations
1. **File Existence**: All files referenced in `index.json` must exist
2. **Required Fields**: `index.json` entries must have id, title, subtitle, file
3. **Markdown Syntax**: Valid markdown with proper frontmatter
4. **Frontmatter Requirements**: Required fields present and valid
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: No duplicate IDs or orders

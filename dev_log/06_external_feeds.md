# Unit 06: External RSS Feed Integration

## Objective

Integrate external RSS feeds for software and football sections at build time, displaying title + paragraph + feed content exactly like original allende.nz implementation. Hard fail deployment if feeds unavailable.

## Implementation

### Technical Approach

1. **RSS Feed Integration**
   - Separate RSS feeds for software and football sections
   - Build-time fetching during Astro static generation
   - Hard failure if external feeds are unavailable (stops GitHub Actions deploy)
   - Display format: title + paragraph + extracted feed content

2. **Feed Processing**
   - Fetch RSS feeds during build process
   - Parse and extract relevant content (title, description, link, date)
   - Integrate seamlessly with existing autogenerated content
   - Maintain existing section structure and styling

3. **Error Handling**
   - Build fails if RSS feeds cannot be fetched
   - No fallback content - deployment stops on feed failure
   - GitHub Actions will not deploy if build fails
   - Clear error messages for debugging feed issues

4. **Content Display**
   - Preserve existing section content (title + paragraph)
   - Append RSS feed content below autogenerated content
   - Consistent styling with portfolio theme
   - Responsive design for feed items

### Key Decisions

- **Build-Time Only**: No client-side fetching, all RSS content static at build
- **Hard Failure Strategy**: Build fails if feeds unavailable, preventing deployment
- **No Combined RSS**: Disable existing RSS generation, keep feeds separate
- **Original Format**: Match allende.nz display format exactly
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Leverage existing deployment pipeline failure handling

### Files to Create/Modify

**RSS Integration:**
- `src/utils/rss-fetcher.js` - RSS feed fetching and parsing utility
- `src/content/portfolio/software/index.md` - Update to include RSS integration
- `src/content/portfolio/football/index.md` - Update to include RSS integration

**Build Configuration:**
- `astro.config.mjs` - Configure RSS fetching during build
- `package.json` - Add RSS parsing dependencies if needed

**Page Updates:**
- `src/pages/software/index.astro` - Integrate RSS content display
- `src/pages/football/index.astro` - Integrate RSS content display

**RSS Removal:**
- `src/pages/rss.xml.js` - Remove or disable existing RSS generation
- `astro.config.mjs` - Remove RSS plugin if not needed

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Software section displays external RSS feed content below autogenerated content
- [ ] Football section displays external RSS feed content below autogenerated content
- [ ] RSS feeds fetched successfully at build time
- [ ] Build fails gracefully if RSS feeds unavailable
- [ ] GitHub Actions deployment stops on RSS fetch failure
- [ ] Feed content displays with title, description, link, and date
- [ ] Existing autogenerated content preserved and displayed first
- [ ] Responsive design maintained for feed items
- [ ] No client-side RSS fetching or dynamic content loading
- [ ] Existing RSS generation disabled/removed

## Status: Complete ✅

**Completed:** External RSS feed integration implemented with build-time fetching, hard failure on unavailable feeds, working test feeds integrated (AWS blog + BBC football), RSS generation disabled, and successful build verification (12 pages with RSS content). Ready for you to update RSS_FEEDS with your actual feed URLs.

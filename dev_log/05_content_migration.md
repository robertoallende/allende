# Unit 05: Content Migration

## Objective

Create content structure with one markdown file per section for clean URLs (allende.nz/football), implement autogenerated content for software/football sections, create placeholder content for /x/ routes with complete SEO isolation, and establish projects as single document with project list.

## Implementation

### Technical Approach

1. **Content Structure Setup**
   - Create individual markdown files for each main section
   - Configure routing for clean URLs without filenames
   - Implement content collections for organized content management
   - Set up autogeneration system for dynamic content

2. **Main Section Content**
   - `software/index.md` - Autogenerated tech content and project showcase
   - `football/index.md` - Autogenerated football analysis and insights
   - `projects/index.md` - Single document with comprehensive project list
   - `contact/index.md` - Professional contact information

3. **Hidden Content Placeholders**
   - `/x/piro.md` - Poetry placeholder content
   - `/x/poetry.md` - Creative writing placeholder
   - `/x/about.md` - Conversational about placeholder
   - Complete SEO isolation (no navigation, no sitemap, robots.txt disallow)

4. **Autogeneration System**
   - Software section: Tech expertise, project highlights, development experience
   - Football section: Analysis capabilities, tactical insights, commentary experience
   - Dynamic content showcasing dual expertise areas

### Key Decisions

- **Clean URLs**: Each section accessible via allende.nz/[section] without filename
- **Content Collections**: Use existing portfolio/hidden structure
- **Autogenerated Focus**: Software and football content generated to showcase expertise
- **Complete SEO Isolation**: /x/ routes hidden from navigation, sitemap, and robots.txt
- **Single Projects Document**: Comprehensive project list in one markdown file
- **Skip About**: Leave about section for manual creation later

### Files to Create/Modify

**Main content files:**
- `src/content/portfolio/software/index.md` - Autogenerated software expertise showcase
- `src/content/portfolio/football/index.md` - Autogenerated football analysis showcase
- `src/content/portfolio/projects/index.md` - Comprehensive project list document
- `src/content/portfolio/contact/index.md` - Professional contact information

**Hidden content placeholders:**
- `src/content/hidden/piro.md` - Poetry placeholder
- `src/content/hidden/poetry.md` - Creative writing placeholder
- `src/content/hidden/about.md` - Conversational about placeholder

**SEO isolation:**
- `src/pages/robots.txt.js` - Add Disallow: /x/ rule ✅ (completed)

**Page routing:**
- Update existing page components to render content collections
- Ensure clean URL structure matches content files

# Unit 02: Frontend Development - Subunit 002: Assistant-UI Chat Integration

## Objective

Integrate assistant-ui library to create a modern chat interface, replacing the placeholder homepage with a functional chat system. Establish the foundation for both static conversations and future live AWS Bedrock integration.

## Technical Approach

### Assistant-UI Package Selection
- **@assistant-ui/react** (v0.10.43) - Core chat primitives and runtime
- **@assistant-ui/react-markdown** - Markdown rendering for content
- **@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk** - Future AWS Bedrock integration support

### Architecture Decisions
- **Radix-style primitives** - Composable components for full customization
- **Static runtime** - Pre-built conversations for initial implementation
- **Responsive chat layout** - Mobile-first design with sidebar navigation
- **Theme integration** - Tailwind classes matching existing design system

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Package Installation
1. Install core assistant-ui packages
2. Verify compatibility with existing dependencies
3. Test basic imports and TypeScript support

### Phase 2: Basic Chat Structure
1. Create chat layout components in `components/chat/`
2. Replace homepage with Thread component
3. Implement basic runtime provider setup
4. Add responsive sidebar navigation

### Phase 3: Component Customization
1. Style chat bubbles with Tailwind theme
2. Integrate JetBrains Mono for code blocks
3. Customize message actions and composer
4. Add personal branding elements

### Phase 4: Static Conversation Setup
1. Create mock runtime for testing
2. Implement basic message structure
3. Test auto-scroll and responsive behavior
4. Prepare for static content integration (Unit 2.3)

- All builds pass without errors
- Development server runs smoothly on port 3001

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Package Installation** ✅
- Installed core assistant-ui packages via pnpm
- Verified no conflicts with existing dependencies
- Added 94 new packages successfully

**Phase 2: Basic Chat Structure** ✅
- Created Thread component with assistant-ui primitives
- Built responsive chat layout with proper styling
- Implemented welcome screen with suggestion cards

**Phase 3: Simplified Runtime** ✅
- Initially attempted complex streaming runtime
- Pivoted to simpler state-based approach for better stability
- Created functional demo chat interface

**Phase 4: Testing & Validation** ✅
- Build process completes successfully (114kB bundle)
- Development server runs without issues
- All TypeScript compilation passes
- Responsive design verified

### Files Created/Modified

**New Chat Components:**
- `components/chat/thread.tsx` - Assistant-UI based chat interface (created but simplified)

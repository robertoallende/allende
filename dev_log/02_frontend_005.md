# Unit 02: Frontend Development - Subunit 005: Left Panel Personalization

## Objective

Personalize the left sidebar with Roberto's branding and improve the conversation experience by adding a "New Conversation" mode with inspirational placeholder text and replacing Poetry with Social Media topic.

## Technical Approach

### Left Panel Header Customization
- **Change "Conversations"** → **"Roberto Allende"**
- **Change description** → **"Enthusiastic and tireless maker"**
- **Maintain visual hierarchy** and professional appearance

### New Conversation Feature
- **Empty conversation state** when clicking "New Conversation"
- **Inspirational placeholder**: "Write Truth Is Like Poetry" in input field
- **Clean slate experience** for open-ended conversations
- **Proper state management** for new vs topic conversations

### Topic Updates
- **Remove Poetry topic** from conversation list
- **Add Social Media topic** with relevant content about online presence
- **Update topic icons** and descriptions accordingly
- **Maintain 5-topic structure** for balanced layout

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 3: Topic Content Updates

# Project Plan and Dev Log

This project creates and documents the development of a personal website for the AWS Builder Challenge #2 using Micromanaged Driven Development (MMDD) principles.

## Structure

Each unit represents a major phase in the development, and optional subunits capture specific design or implementation tasks. Files follow the naming convention:

```
<sequence>_<unitname>[_subunit].md
```

For example: `02_content.md` or `05_api-chat_prompt.md`.

## About the Project

### What This Is

A chat-style personal "About Me" website with the following sections: About, Blog, Projects, Poetry, and Contact. Each section is presented as a static chat transcript, with optional live Q\&A powered by Amazon Bedrock (Titan Text-Lite). The project is built to comply with the AWS Builder Challenge rules: HTTPS, working contact form, open-source code, and substantial use of Q Developer.

### Architecture

* **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind + `assistant-ui` for the chat interface
* **Static Content:** JSON/Markdown transcripts in S3, served via CloudFront with ACM certificate
* **APIs:** API Gateway + Lambda

  * `/api/chat`: Titan Text-Lite with context snippets
  * `/api/contact`: SES send + optional S3 store
  * `/api/human`: Human verification (bot checks, CAPTCHA)
* **Safety:** Pre-checks in Lambda (regex, max length, rate limits), strict system prompt, conditional Guardrails
* **Deployment:** Amplify Hosting or GitHub Actions → S3 + CloudFront invalidation

### Technical Stack

* **Languages:** TypeScript, React/Next.js
* **Styling:** TailwindCSS
* **Components:** assistant-ui
* **Cloud:** AWS S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, SES, Bedrock Titan Lite
* **AI Tools:** Amazon Q Developer CLI, Bedrock Guardrails (conditional)
* **Version Control:** GitHub (MIT License)

# Unit 02: Frontend Development - Subunit 003: Static Conversations with ThreadList

## Objective

Enhance the existing assistant-ui integration from Unit 2.2 with a ChatGPT-style interface using ThreadList for conversation management. Create separate conversation threads for each topic (About, Blog, Projects, Poetry, Contact) with rich content rendering and seamless thread switching.

## Technical Approach

### ChatGPT-Style Interface with Assistant-UI
- **ThreadListPrimitive** - Left sidebar for conversation history like ChatGPT
- **Separate threads per topic** - Each topic gets its own conversation thread
- **Thread switching** - Click to switch between About, Blog, Projects, etc.
- **Rich content with @assistant-ui/react-markdown** - Markdown rendering within threads
- **Thread management** - New thread creation, archiving, titles

### Layout Architecture
```tsx
<main className="grid h-dvh grid-cols-[250px,1fr] gap-4 p-4">
  <ThreadList />      {/* Left: Topic conversations */}
  <Thread />          {/* Right: Current conversation */}
</main>
```

### Content Strategy
- **About Thread**: Personal background, skills, experience, career journey
- **Blog Thread**: Recent posts, technical insights, development thoughts  
- **Projects Thread**: Portfolio showcase with tech stacks, demos, GitHub links
- **Poetry Thread**: Creative writing, technical poetry, personal expressions
- **Contact Thread**: Professional info, availability, collaboration opportunities

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: ThreadList Layout Setup
1. Create ChatGPT-style grid layout with ThreadList and Thread
2. Implement ThreadListPrimitive components with custom styling
3. Add thread creation for each topic (About, Blog, Projects, Poetry, Contact)
4. Style ThreadList to match existing theme system

### Phase 2: Multi-Thread Runtime
1. Enhance runtime to support multiple conversation threads
2. Create thread-specific ChatModelAdapters for each topic
3. Implement thread switching and state management
4. Add thread titles and metadata for each topic

### Phase 3: Rich Content per Thread
1. Use @assistant-ui/react-markdown for content rendering in each thread
2. Create topic-specific conversation data for each thread
3. Add follow-up suggestions within each thread context
4. Implement thread-specific conversation flows

### Phase 4: Thread Management Features
1. Add "New Thread" functionality for topics
2. Implement thread archiving and organization
3. Add thread titles based on topic and conversation state
4. Create smooth thread switching animations

## Files to Create/Modify

10. ‚úÖ Foundation ready for real content (Unit 2.4) across all threads

## Implementation Examples

### Correct ThreadList Layout
```tsx
// ChatGPT-style layout with assistant-ui ThreadList
export function ChatInterface() {
  return (
    <div className="h-screen bg-background text-foreground">
      <div className="grid h-full grid-cols-[250px,1fr]">
        {/* Left sidebar - Topic threads */}
        <div className="border-r border-border bg-muted/30">
          <ThreadList />
        </div>
        
        {/* Right area - Current conversation */}
        <div className="flex flex-col">
          <ThreadHeader />
          <Thread />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Topic-Specific Thread Creation
```tsx
// Create threads for each topic
const topicThreads = [
  { id: "about", title: "About Roberto", icon: "üëã" },
  { id: "blog", title: "Blog Posts", icon: "üìù" },
  { id: "projects", title: "Projects", icon: "üöÄ" },
  { id: "poetry", title: "Poetry", icon: "üé≠" },
  { id: "contact", title: "Contact", icon: "üìß" },
];

function TopicThreadList() {
  return (
    <ThreadListPrimitive.Root>
      {topicThreads.map(topic => (
        <TopicThreadItem key={topic.id} topic={topic} />
      ))}
    </ThreadListPrimitive.Root>
  );
}
```

### Thread-Specific ChatModelAdapter
```tsx
// Different adapters for each thread topic
const createTopicAdapter = (topic: string): ChatModelAdapter => ({
  async run({ messages }) {
    const conversationData = await getTopicConversation(topic);
    const response = await getTopicResponse(topic, messages, conversationData);
    
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: response.content }],
      metadata: { topic, followUps: response.followUps },
    };
  },
});
```

## Antipatterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't Create Single Thread with Topic Switching
```tsx
// DON'T DO THIS - single thread with manual topic switching
function SingleThreadWithTopics() {
  const [currentTopic, setCurrentTopic] = useState("about");
  return (
    <Thread>
      <TopicSwitcher onTopicChange={setCurrentTopic} />
      {/* Manual topic management */}
    </Thread>
  );
}
```

### ‚ùå Don't Bypass ThreadList for Custom Sidebar
```tsx
// DON'T DO THIS - custom sidebar instead of ThreadList
function CustomSidebar() {
  return (
    <div className="custom-sidebar">
      <CustomThreadItem />
      <CustomThreadItem />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### ‚ùå Don't Create Separate Pages for Topics
```tsx
// DON'T DO THIS - separate routes
// /about, /blog, /projects pages
```

### ‚ùå Don't Manage Thread State Manually
```tsx
// DON'T DO THIS - manual thread management
const [threads, setThreads] = useState([]);
const [activeThread, setActiveThread] = useState(null);
```

## Correct Patterns to Follow

### ‚úÖ Use ThreadListPrimitive Components
```tsx
// DO THIS - use assistant-ui's ThreadList system
<ThreadListPrimitive.Root>
  <ThreadListPrimitive.Items 
    components={{ ThreadListItem: TopicThreadItem }}
  />
</ThreadListPrimitive.Root>
```

### ‚úÖ Leverage Assistant-UI Thread Management
```tsx
// DO THIS - let assistant-ui handle thread state
function TopicThreadItem() {
  return (
    <ThreadListItemPrimitive.Root>
      <ThreadListItemPrimitive.Trigger>
        <ThreadListItemPrimitive.Title />
      </ThreadListItemPrimitive.Trigger>
    </ThreadListItemPrimitive.Root>
  );
}
```

### ‚úÖ Use Multi-Thread Runtime
```tsx
// DO THIS - runtime that supports multiple threads
const multiThreadRuntime = useMultiThreadRuntime({
  threads: topicThreads,
  adapters: topicAdapters,
});
```

### ‚úÖ ChatGPT-Style Grid Layout
```tsx
// DO THIS - proper grid layout like ChatGPT
<main className="grid h-dvh grid-cols-[250px,1fr]">
  <ThreadList />
  <Thread />
</main>
```

This unit will involve:
- Setting up ThreadListPrimitive components with custom styling
- Creating multi-thread runtime supporting topic-specific conversations
- Implementing thread-specific ChatModelAdapters for each topic
- Building ChatGPT-style layout with responsive thread management
- Integrating @assistant-ui/react-markdown within thread contexts

## Next Steps

After completion, this will enable:
- **002_frontend_004**: Real markdown content integration across all topic threads
- **Enhanced thread management** with archiving and organization
- **Scalable conversation system** supporting unlimited topic threads
- **ChatGPT-like user experience** with familiar thread switching

## Status: Ready to Start

**Target Implementation Date:** August 22, 2025  
**Estimated Duration:** 75-90 minutes

### Key Focus Areas

1. **Use ThreadListPrimitive properly** - Don't create custom sidebar components
2. **Multi-thread architecture** - Support separate conversations per topic
3. **ChatGPT-style layout** - Grid layout with sidebar and main area
4. **Thread-specific content** - Each topic has its own conversation data
5. **Assistant-UI thread management** - Leverage built-in thread switching and state

### Success Metrics

- ChatGPT-style interface with working ThreadList sidebar
- 5 separate topic threads (About, Blog, Projects, Poetry, Contact)
- Smooth thread switching using assistant-ui's native functionality
- Rich content rendering with @assistant-ui/react-markdown per thread
- Responsive layout maintaining usability on all screen sizes
- Full integration with Unit 2.2's theming system

The goal is to create a professional ChatGPT-style interface that fully leverages assistant-ui's ThreadList capabilities while providing engaging topic-specific conversations.
